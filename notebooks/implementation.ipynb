      "The Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve is a graphical representation of the survival probability of subjects in a study over time, typically used in medical research and statistics. It's named after Edwin Kaplan and Maurice Meier, who first described it in 1958.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curve shows the proportion of patients who have not experienced an event (such as death, relapse, or recurrence) at different time points. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the survival probability.\n",

      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Censoring**: In a study, some participants may still be alive at the end of the observation period, but their outcome status (e.g., dead or alive) is not known. These participants are said to be censored.\n",
      "2. **Event occurrence**: When an event occurs (e.g., death), the participant's survival time is recorded as the time of event occurrence.\n",
      "3. **Kaplan-Meier estimation**: The Kaplan-Meier estimator calculates the survival probability at each time point by considering only the participants who have not experienced the event up to that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting curve shows:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Survival probability**: The proportion of participants still alive at a given time point.\n",
      "* **Hazard function**: The rate at which events occur, which can be inferred from the shape and slope of the curve.\n",

      "* An increasing curve suggests an increasing risk of event occurrence over time.\n",

      "* The x-intercept represents the median survival time.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Objective:**\n",
      "The primary objective of the RoDTEP Scheme is to refund duties and taxes borne by exporters, including prior stage cumulative indirect taxes on goods and services used in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Eligibility:**\n",
      "The scheme is available for exports made by categories mentioned in para 4.55 (x), (xi), and (xii) above.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rebate Nature:**\n",
      "The rebate under the RoDTEP Scheme will be used only for payment of duty of Customs leviable under the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, specifically Basic Customs Duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scheme Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Output-Outcome Framework:** A broad-level monitoring framework will be maintained and monitored at regular intervals.\n",
      "2. **Risk Management System (RMS):** An IT-based RMS will be implemented by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Department of Revenue, to physically verify records on a sample basis.\n",
      "3. **Inter-Ministerial Committee:** A committee named \"RoDTEP Policy Committee (RPC)\" will be formed to consider residual issues arising under the scheme. The committee will comprise members from the Department of Commerce and Department of Revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision-Making:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ceiling Rates:** Ceiling rates for eligible items will be determined by a Committee in the Department of Revenue/Drawback Division, with representation from various line ministries and experts.\n",
      "2. **Inclusion/Exclusion:** The Appendix 4R containing eligible RoDTEP export items, rates, and per unit value will be updated at a later date.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Budgeting:**\n",
      "The overall budget for the RoDTEP Scheme will be finalized by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Department of Commerce (DoC), taking into account relevant factors. The scheme will operate within a budgetary framework for each financial year, with necessary calibrations and revisions made as required.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Principles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **No provision for remission of arrears or contingent liabilities is permissible under the Scheme to be carried over to the next financial year.**\n",
      "2. **The sequence of introduction of the Scheme across sectors will be prioritized by the Department of Commerce and Department of Revenue.**\n",
      "3. **The degree of benefit to be given on various items within the rates set by the Committee will be determined based on recommendations from the RoDTEP Committee.**\n",
