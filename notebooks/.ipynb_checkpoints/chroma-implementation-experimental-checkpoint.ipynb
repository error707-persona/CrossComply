      "The curve shows the proportion of patients who have not experienced an event (such as death, relapse, or recurrence) at different time points. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents the survival probability.\n",

      "2. **Event occurrence**: When an event occurs (e.g., death), the participant's survival time is recorded as the time of event occurrence.\n",
      "3. **Kaplan-Meier estimation**: The Kaplan-Meier estimator calculates the survival probability at each time point by considering only the participants who have not experienced the event up to that point.\n",

      "The resulting curve shows:\n",

      "\n",
      "**Objective:**\n",
      "The primary objective of the RoDTEP Scheme is to refund duties and taxes borne by exporters, including prior stage cumulative indirect taxes on goods and services used in production.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Eligibility:**\n",
      "The scheme is available for exports made by categories mentioned in para 4.55 (x), (xi), and (xii) above.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rebate Nature:**\n",
      "The rebate under the RoDTEP Scheme will be used only for payment of duty of Customs leviable under the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, specifically Basic Customs Duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Scheme Structure:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Output-Outcome Framework:** A broad-level monitoring framework will be maintained and monitored at regular intervals.\n",
      "2. **Risk Management System (RMS):** An IT-based RMS will be implemented by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Department of Revenue, to physically verify records on a sample basis.\n",
      "3. **Inter-Ministerial Committee:** A committee named \"RoDTEP Policy Committee (RPC)\" will be formed to consider residual issues arising under the scheme. The committee will comprise members from the Department of Commerce and Department of Revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Decision-Making:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ceiling Rates:** Ceiling rates for eligible items will be determined by a Committee in the Department of Revenue/Drawback Division, with representation from various line ministries and experts.\n",
      "2. **Inclusion/Exclusion:** The Appendix 4R containing eligible RoDTEP export items, rates, and per unit value will be updated at a later date.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Budgeting:**\n",
      "The overall budget for the RoDTEP Scheme will be finalized by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Department of Commerce (DoC), taking into account relevant factors. The scheme will operate within a budgetary framework for each financial year, with necessary calibrations and revisions made as required.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Principles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **No provision for remission of arrears or contingent liabilities is permissible under the Scheme to be carried over to the next financial year.**\n",
      "2. **The sequence of introduction of the Scheme across sectors will be prioritized by the Department of Commerce and Department of Revenue.**\n",
      "3. **The degree of benefit to be given on various items within the rates set by the Committee will be determined based on recommendations from the RoDTEP Committee.**\n",

      "5. **Environmental Considerations**: Be aware of environmental regulations and guidelines for electronic waste disposal in the destination country.\n",
      "6. **Customs Clearance**: Understand the customs clearance process and requirements for your specific product category to avoid delays or penalties.\n",
      "7. **Product Certification**: If required, obtain necessary certifications (e.g., CE marking) for your products to ensure compliance with European Union regulations.\n",
      "8. **Insurance and Liability**: Consider purchasing insurance to cover potential risks associated with exporting electronics, such as damage during transit or product liability claims.\n",
      "9. **Regulatory Compliance in Multiple Countries**: Be aware that different countries have varying regulations regarding electronic exports. Research the specific requirements for each destination country you plan to export to.\n",
      "10. **Stay Up-to-Date**: Regularly review and update your knowledge on changing regulations, standards, and best practices to ensure compliance and avoid potential issues.\n",
